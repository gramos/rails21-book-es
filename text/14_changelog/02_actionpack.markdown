\* Added session(:on) to turn session management back on in a controller subclass if the superclass turned it off (Peter Jones) [#136]
 
\* Change the request forgery protection to go by Content-Type instead of request.format so that you can't bypass it by POSTing to "#{request.uri}.xml" [rick]

\* Make map.root accept a single symbol as an argument to declare an alias.  #10818 [bscofield] 
 
  e.g.  map.dashboard '/dashboard', :controller=>'dashboard'
        map.root      :dashboard

\* UrlWriter respects relative\_url\_root.  #10748 [Cheah Chu Yeow]
 
\* The asset\_host block takes the controller request as an optional second argument. Example: use a single asset host for SSL requests.  #10549 [Cheah Chu Yeow, Peter B, Tom Taylor]
