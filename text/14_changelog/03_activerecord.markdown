## ActiveRecord


 
\* Add ActiveRecord::Base.sti\_name that checks ActiveRecord::Base#store\_full\_sti\_class? and returns either the full or demodulized name. [rick]
 
\* Add first/last methods to associations/named\_scope. Resolved #226. [Ryan Bates]
 
\* Added SQL escaping for :limit and :offset #288 [Aaron Bedra, Steven Bristol, Jonathan Wiess] 
 
\* Added first/last methods to associations/named\_scope. Resolved #226. [Ryan Bates]
 
\* Ensure hm:t preloading honours reflection options. Resolves #137. [Frederick Cheung]
 
\* Added protection against duplicate migration names (Aslak HellesÃ¸y) [#112]
 
\* Base#instantiate\_time\_object: eliminate check for Time.zone, since we can assume this is set if time\_zone\_aware\_attributes is set to true [Geoff Buesing]
 
\* Time zone aware attribute methods use Time.zone.parse instead of #to\_time for String arguments, so that offset information in String is respected. Resolves #105. [Scott Fleckenstein, Geoff Buesing]
 
\* Added change\_table for migrations (Jeff Dean) [#71]. Example:
 
    change_table :videos do |t|
      t.timestamps                          # adds created_at, updated_at
      t.belongs_to :goat                    # adds goat_id integer
      t.string :name, :email, :limit => 20  # adds name and email both with a 20 char limit
      t.remove :name, :email                # removes the name and email columns
    end
 
\* Fixed has\_many :through .create with no parameters caused a "can't dup NilClass" error (Steven Soroka) [#85]
 
\* Added block-setting of attributes for Base.create like Base.new already has (Adam Meehan) [#39]
 
\* Fixed that pessimistic locking you reference the quoted table name (Josh Susser) [#67]
 
\* Fixed that change\_column should be able to use :null => true on a field that formerly had false [Nate Wiger] [#26]
 
\* Added that the MySQL adapter should map integer to either smallint, int, or bigint depending on the :limit just like PostgreSQL [DHH]
 
\* Change validates\_uniqueness\_of :case\_sensitive option default back to true (from [9160]).  Love your database columns, don't LOWER them.  [rick]
 
\* Add support for interleaving migrations by storing which migrations have run in the new schema\_migrations table. Closes #11493 [jordi]
 
\* ActiveRecord::Base#sum defaults to 0 if no rows are returned.  Closes #11550 [kamal]
 
\* Ensure that respond\_to? considers dynamic finder methods. Closes #11538. [floehopper]
 
\* Ensure that save on parent object fails for invalid has\_one association. Closes #10518. [Pratik]
 
\* Remove duplicate code from associations. [Pratik]
 
\* Refactor HasManyThroughAssociation to inherit from HasManyAssociation. Association callbacks and <association>\_ids= now work with hm:t. #11516 [rubyruy]
 
\* Ensure HABTM#create and HABTM#build do not load entire association. [Pratik]
 
\* Improve documentation. [Xavier Noria, Jack Danger Canty, leethal]
 
\* Tweak ActiveRecord::Base#to\_json to include a root value in the returned hash: {"post": {"title": ...}} [rick]
 
	Post.find(1).to_json # => {"title": ...}
	config.active_record.include_root_in_json = true
	Post.find(1).to_json # => {"post": {"title": ...}}
 
\* Add efficient #include? to AssociationCollection (for has\_many/has\_many :through/habtm).  [stopdropandrew]
 
\* PostgreSQL: create\_ and drop\_database support.  #9042 [ez, pedz, nicksieger]
 
\* Ensure that validates\_uniqueness\_of works with with\_scope. Closes #9235. [nik.wakelin, cavalle]
 
\* Partial updates include only unsaved attributes. Off by default; set YourClass.partial\_updates = true to enable.  [Jeremy Kemper]
 
\* Removing unnecessary uses\_tzinfo helper from tests, given that TZInfo is now bundled [Geoff Buesing]
 
\* Fixed that validates\_size\_of :within works in associations #11295, #10019 [cavalle]
 
\* Track changes to unsaved attributes.  [Jeremy Kemper]
 
\* Switched to UTC-timebased version numbers for migrations and the schema. This will as good as eliminate the problem of multiple migrations getting the same version assigned in different branches. Also added rake db:migrate:up/down to apply individual migrations that may need to be run when you merge branches #11458 [jbarnette]
 
\* Fixed that has\_many :through would ignore the hash conditions #11447 [miloops]
 
\* Fix issue where the :uniq option of a has\_many :through association is ignored when find(:all) is called.  Closes #9407 [cavalle]
 
\* Fix duplicate table alias error when including an association with a has\_many :through association on the same join table.  Closes #7310 [cavalle]
 
\* More efficient association preloading code that compacts a through\_records array in a central location.  Closes #11427 [danger]
 
\* Improve documentation. [Radar, Jan De Poorter, chuyeow, xaviershay, danger, miloops, Xavier Noria,  Sunny Ripert]
 
\* Fixed that ActiveRecord#Base.find\_or\_create/initialize would not honor attr\_protected/accessible when used with a hash #11422 [miloops]
 
\* Added ActiveRecord#Base.all/first/last as aliases for find(:all/:first/:last) #11413 [nkallen, thechrisoshow]
 
\* Merge the has\_finder gem, renamed as 'named\_scope'.  #11404 [nkallen]
 
	class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
		named_scope :published, :conditions => {:published => true}
		named_scope :popular, :conditions => ...
  	end
 
	Article.published.paginate(:page => 1)
	Article.published.popular.count
	Article.popular.find(:first)
	Article.popular.find(:all, :conditions => {...})
