#Introducción

Alrededor de julio de 2004 David Heinemeier Hansson lanzó la versión pública del framework Ruby on Rails, el cual surgió como consecuencia del desarrollo de una aplicación llamada Basecamp. Después de tres años, el 7 de Diciembre de 2007 se publicó Ruby on Rails 2.0 con una cantidad importante de cambios.

Six months have passed since then, and during this time more than **1400 developers** from all around the world have contributed  **1600 patches** to the framework. Today, June 1st 2008, version 2.1 of the Ruby on Rails framework was released.

Major new features according to David:

* Timezones
* Dirty tracking
* Gem Dependencies
* Named scope
* UTC-based migrations
* Better caching

As always, to update or install the new version:

        gem install rails
