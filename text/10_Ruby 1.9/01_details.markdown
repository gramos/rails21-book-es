## Details

The main focus of Rails changes was Ruby 1.9, even minor details were analyzed to increase Rails compatibility with the new Ruby version. Details like changing from **File.exists?** to **File.exist?** were not kept aside.

Also, in Ruby 1.9, the module **Base64** (base64.rb) was removed, because of that, all references to it were replaced by **ActiveSupport::Base64**.
